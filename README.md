# leetCode

This a repo that contains my solutions to the blind75 at leetcode!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

All solutions are written in JS.

## Optimizations

Some of the fun is writing the first solution coming to mind and then optimizing the solution with faster algorithms.

## Lessons Learned:

My instinct is always go for the O(N^2) solution because it is easier to visualize. As I am working through the challengers, I begin to see why certain algorithms are more efficient.

Recursion may not always be the optimal choice.
